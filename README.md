**My python scripts**

- [String transformer](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-codewars/blob/master/String_transformer.py) - Given a string, return a new string that has transformed based on the input - rules: change case of every character, ie. lower case to upper case, upper case to lower case, reverse the order of words from the input, handle multiple spaces. Excersise from codewars
- [Exes_and_Ohs](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Exes_and_Ohs) - Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char. Excersise from codewars
- [Send an e-mail](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/send_email) - send an e-mail from outlook mailbox, with attachment
- [Count words](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Count_words) - takes words from column in one excel file and counts occurrences of them in another file. Final file with numbers of occurrences is saved on disc.
- [Counting duplicates](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Counting_duplicates) - Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits. Example: "aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`).

- [Strip comments](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Strip_comments) - it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out. Example: result = solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"]) ; result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas". Excersise from codewars
- [Add commas to number](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Add_commas) - task is to convert a given number into a string with commas added for easier readability. The number should be rounded to 3 decimal places and the commas should be added at intervals of three digits before the decimal point. There does not need to be a comma at the end of the number. Example - commas(-1000000.123) == "-1,000,000.123" . Excersise from codewars
- [Sympy math](https://github.com/szyymek/Python-scripts/blob/master/Sympy_examples.py) - symbolic mathematics in python using SymPy
